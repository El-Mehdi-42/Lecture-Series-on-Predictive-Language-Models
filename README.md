# Lecture-Series-on-Predictive-Language-Models
This course covers textual data manipulation from extraction to automation. Participants will extract text from sources like the web and PDFs, apply preprocessing in Python (cleaning, segmentation, embeddings), and integrate NLP with Machine Learning. By the end, they will efficiently handle text data for intelligent language-based applications.
