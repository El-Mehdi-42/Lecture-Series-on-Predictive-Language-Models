A cloudy night for most, with some clear spells developing at times, particularly over northern 
England. 

A southerly wind throughout with some gustiness over Scotland, Northern Ireland, 
and the north of England and Wales. 

A band of rain approached from the west over Northern 

Ireland and Scotland in the early hours. T
he band of rain pushed into Northern Ireland and 
western Scotland during the morning, accompanied by gusty winds. 

Elsewhere was 
predominantly cloudy and mild for the time of year. 

By mid-afternoon afternoon, the band of 
rain had pushed away from Northern Ireland into northern England and southern Scotland. 

The evening brought a renewed batch of rain to western Scotland, with some heavy falls 
over high ground, as the earlier band was hovering over Wales and northern England, 
gradually losing intensity. 

The first part of the night would see patchy rain in the west, while 
conditions were mostly dry in the east, but breezy everywhere.
